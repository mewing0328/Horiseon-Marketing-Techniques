# Week-1-Challenge---ME
MaSandra Ewing's Week 1 Challenge

## Description
Marketing agency project is an on-the-job ticket in which I **refractored** an existing codebase that follows accessibility standards. By improving the web accessibility, this website is optimized for search engines like Google. 

### Tasks completed
```
Improved the long-term sustainability of the codebase by:
* Tested links for correct functionality
* Removed redundancies in index.html and style.css
* Revised the title element to include a concise, descriptive title
* Replaced HTML elements with semantic HTML elements
* Ordered elements to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Organized heading attributes to fall in sequential order
* Organized CSS selectors by elements and classes
* Ordered CSS selectors to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
* Included detailed comments of changes in index.html and style.css
* Added accessible alt attributes for image elements
```

## Links
My Deployed Website
[Link to the code repository]

My Code Respository

## References and tutorials utilized 
* [Make a README](https://www.makeareadme.com/)
* [How to Write a Good README File](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/)
* Credit to [pkriengsiri's README.md file](https://github.com/pkriengsiri/horiseon-code-refactor). I used it as an example to write out my README.md for this project.

## Usage
The layout is designed for desktop viewing. Resolution smaller than 768px will not render some elements properly.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome for recommendations for optimizing screen size.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.

You can also refer to this [YouTube video on enabling GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) for more guidance.

> **Important**: It might take a few minutes for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project does not deploy or display correctly, check that all file paths in your application are relative and use the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, an inccorect capital or lowercase letter could cause problems in deployment.

Be sure to add, commit, and push your work to see the most up-to-date version of your app!

## Grading Requirements

> **Note**: If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> * A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> * A repository that only includes starter code

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria: 

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following code improvements:

  * Application's links all function correctly.

### Deployment: 32%

* Application deployed at live URL.

* Application loads with no errors.

* Application GitHub URL submitted.

* GitHub repository contains application code.

### Application Quality: 15%

* Application resembles mock-up provided in the Challenge instructions (at least 90%).

### Repository Quality: 13%

* Repository has a unique name.

* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

* Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.

* Repository contains quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.
