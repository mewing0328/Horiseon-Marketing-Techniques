# Week-1-Challenge---ME
MaSandra Ewing's Week 1 Challenge

## Description
Marketing agency project is an on-the-job ticket in which I **refractored** an existing codebase that follows accessibility standards. By improving the web accessibility, this website is optimized for search engines like Google. 

### Tasks completed
```
Improved the long-term sustainability of the codebase by:
* Tested links for correct functionality
* Removed redundancies in index.html and style.css
* Revised the title element to include a concise, descriptive title
* Replaced HTML elements with semantic HTML elements
* Ordered elements to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Organized heading attributes to fall in sequential order
* Organized CSS selectors by elements and classes
* Ordered CSS selectors to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
* Included detailed comments of changes in index.html and style.css
* Added accessible alt attributes for image elements
```
